            <h5>History</h5>
            <p> C A Jewelers had modest beginnings. In 1987 Mr. and Mrs. Lam opened a small booth in Chicagoâ€™s jewelry district.  With a strong work ethic and lots of perseverance, Mr. and Mrs. Lam dedicated their lives day and night to the success of the store.  Along with their hard work C. A. Jewelers was founded on three simple but enduring beliefs; Quality, Trust, and Value.  Each one had a special meaning to Mr. and Mrs. Lam and their customers. </p>
            <br></br>
            <br></br>

            <p>Today these beliefs and unrivaled dedication have paid off.  In fact, they have become the cornerstones of CA Jewelers, helping them become one of the most trusted jewelry stores in Chicago.   With over thousands of diamonds sold, C A Jewelers is endeavoring to expand its presence into the Internet, reaching customers throughout the world.</p>
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            <p>CA Jewelers is a family owned and operated business with a complete full-service jewelry store.  This allows them to provide the personalized service and attention you would receive at a small store but with the quality control and production of a large operation.</p>
            <br></br>
