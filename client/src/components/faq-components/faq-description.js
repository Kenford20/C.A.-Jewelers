            <br></br>
            <h5>Do you guarentee your diamonds?</h5>
            <p>We guarantee the side stones for two years and after that time period, we will charge you at our cost.</p>
            <br></br>
            <h5>What is your refund policy on custom-designed pieces?</h5>
            <p>Custom-designed jewelry is unique and made especially for you, therefore we are unable to refund custom orders.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>We show you wax design before going to the next phase. From beginning to end you’ll be very much involved with the process to feel confident your jewelry piece will be special. If for any reason you still do not like the piece, we can do a store credit or exchange.</p>
