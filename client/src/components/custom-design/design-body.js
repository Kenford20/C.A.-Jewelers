                <p>Everyoneâ€™s engagement ring should be unique and here at C.A. Jewelers, we want to help realize your dream ring or any other jewelry piece you can imagine. The custom process is quick and easy. Depending on the complexity of the design, the whole process can take anywhere from three to five weeks. </p>

                        <p>We encourage everyone to look to the internet for inspiration and ideas. Pinterest is an awesome starting point. A lot of our customers bring in pictures and we use it as a starting point in designing your perfect jewelry piece. </p>

                        <p>Once the design is ready, we will build a wax model/prototype for you to see and make any changes as you see fit. The wax model can be made either by having Yee, our master craftsman, hand-carve your design into wax or by having Tom, our talented CAD drafter, draw it on our CAD software and 3-D print the wax model.  </p>

                        <p>After you approve the wax model, we will begin the casting process and finalize the product. After the wax has been casted into metal, our shop will carefully set the diamonds and gem stones in and make sure everything is tight and ready to go. We finish it off by polishing the ring and rhodium dipping it if the ring is white gold.</p>
