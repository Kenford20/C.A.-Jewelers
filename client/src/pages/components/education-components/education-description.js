            <p>At C.A. Jewelers, we carefully hand select each diamond in our showcase. Not only do we look for the best wholesale price but also the best quality.  It is important to find the right balance between quality and value.</p>
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            <h5>Here are some key points to look for in a diamond: </h5>
            <p>Cut is not only referred by the shape of the diamond but also the proportions, symmetry and polish. In terms of visual aesthetics, the GIA Cut Scale ranges from Excellent to Poor. (For round brilliant diamond) Remember, there are no two stones that are alike. Having the highest clarity and color does not guarantee having the most brilliant stone. Our professional staff will help you find the right one for you.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>Look for reputable certification such as:  GIA, AGS, and EGL certification.  Can the certificate tell you the beauty of the diamond? Not necessarily. As mentioned, there are no two diamonds alike. Even within the same quality grade. Comparing them side by side can be helpful to know what to look for. Each person has their criteria in a diamond. Do not let a piece a paper tell you what you need. After all, she will only be wearing the diamond, not the paper.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>Compare similar quality loose diamonds, side by side. The best way to judge a stone is to look at it in person. You don’t have to be a gemologist to see which diamond sparkle the most.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>Finding the perfect ring can be overwhelming. Make sure that the person you are purchasing answers all your questions and concerns. At C.A. Jewelers, we don’t like to pressure you to getting one thing. We want you to be confident and happy with your purchase.</p>
